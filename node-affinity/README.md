Reason: Pods are hosted on dedicated nodes

node affinitiy allows advanced configuration possibilites

Examples:

---
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: size
            operator: In
            values:
            - Large
            - Medium

    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: size
            operator: NotIn
            values:
            - Small
